### Introduction

This project implements a shell, which allows for execution of programs from a command line (text input) interface. Commands (e.g. "echo hello") are mostly passed through to C++'s execvp() for execution, and the shell catches some special operators and commands. These are as follows:

- Ordered/relative execution
    - Bash connectors ( "||", ";", "&&")
    - Parentheses (inner parentheses are executed first)
- Handling of comments ("echo hello #" prints hello )
- "exit" causes RShell to clean up its own memory and exit
- test command
	- "test" works similarly to bash - allows for -e, -f, -d flags
	- symbolic test calls: "[ -e /path/to/file ]" is handled
- quotes are allowed - eg "echo " ##### "" doesn't stop at #
- \>, \>>, |, and \< for file redirection

Some planned special constructs to catch:

- Aliases ( eg "i" â†’ "sudo apt-get install" )
- Storage of state variables, like "pwd"
- Construction of the RShell with a config file, a la .bashrc or .vimrc

Parsing of statements happens in header/shuntingYardConstruct.h, which directly constructs the postfix queue from the input string. The algorithm is based around Shunting Yard, and roughly follows these steps:

	for char c in inString

		if c and previous chars are equivalent to "&&", "||", or ";". This means we're currently on an operator.
			Flush the buffer (except for the length of the operator) and store it in a Subcommand.
			If c is >, >>, or |, we need to track the input from what came before it. Purge memory and store the entire left side of the
				commandString into a Subcommand. This is allowed as popen() handles operators correctly.
			Flush the operator to its operator type, such as AndToken, OrToken, or SemiToken.
			Handle the Subcommand and operator Token in the same manner as Shunting Yard. In particular,
				Subcommand gets sent to the outputQueue, and the operator Token gets sent to the operator stack.
				If there are any operators on the operator stack, push those to the outputQueue before pushing onto the stack.
		else if c is ( or [ or ",
			then a block of inString needs to grouped and dealt with.
			first, find the relevant "close" position for this char. If c = (, then close = ).
			this skips nested parentheses and only outputs the depth when the close paren is at the same depth.
			if parentheses
				recursively run shuntingYardConstruct and place the outputQueue into a ParenthesisToken. This is for proper handling of precedence order.
			if brackets
				set the inside to a TestToken
			if "
				add the quote block to the buffer
		else
			store c in a buffer of strings

	if buffer is nonempty
		flush buffer to a Subcommand and push it onto outputQueue.

Execution is comparatively more straightforward and follows the same pattern as the Shunting Yard algorithm:

	for Token\* t in outputQueue
		if not operator
			push to execution stack
		else
			pop top two elements from execution stack
			set first and second elements to operator right and left children (respectively)
			retval = operator->execute()
			delete any leftover StorageTokens from previous steps
			create a new StorageToken(retval) so future operators have access to the return value and push it to the execution stack

### Why are parentheses treated recursively?

Consider the following command:

echo a || (false && echo c)

When tokenized inorder, this command can be represented as:

{Subcommand(echo a), OrToken(||), Subcommand(false), AndToken(&&), Subcommand(echo c)}

Canonical Shunting Yard would produce this as the queue output:

{Subcommand(echo a), Subcommand(false), Subcommand(echo c), AndToken(&&), OrToken(||)}

While this would be correct for parentheses if we were doing algebra, we don't want the right to execute at all when doing bash connectors properly.

However, if we wrap the parenthesis group into a ParenthesisToken, then execution works properly. Here is the inorder form:

{Subcommand(echo a), OrToken(||), ParenthesisToken({Subcommand(false), AndToken(&&), Subcommand(echo c)})}

After Shunting Yard:

{Subcommand(echo a), ParenthesisToken(...), OrToken(||)}

which produces the expected behavior.

### Prototypes/Research

For error-tolerant execution of commands, the safest way is probably to fork a process and run execvp() in that fork. This allows for extraction of errors - if the child process fails, the parent process can monitor the return state of the child. The functionality of waitpid() and fork() are demonstrated in ~/prototype/prototype_waitpid.cpp and the functionality of execvp() is demonstrated in ~/prototype/prototype_execvp.cpp.

For our parser, early functionality can be found in ~/src/parser.cpp, with the imported header files demonstrating functionality. Both ~/header/splitSpaces.h and ~/header/filterComments.h have tests in ~/unit_tests/test.cpp. 

For details on our Shunting Yard functionality, see the Introduction.
